# ATM-with-GUI

Which started off just as a basic ATM Simulator 2 months ago suggested by the r/learnpython community turned into a better version of a newbie's try at building an ATM Simulator with GUI. It is not much but for a beginner like me who started python about 2 months ago means a lot. Please be sure to leave your thoughts on how can I make the code and GUI better and do criticize on which things could be done even better (except replacing Json for Pickle because I wanted the ease of using pickling in this project but for future projects json will be used).
